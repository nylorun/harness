Add `sandbox()`: one `.use(sandbox())` gives an agent Runtime-executed `bash`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `grep` and `glob` tools on an isolated machine with a persistent `/workspace`. The Runtime selects a microsandbox microVM where available, otherwise an in-process virtual shell, enforces deny-by-default egress presets, owns sandbox lifecycle, and reports its choice through `GET /v1/host/sandbox`, the `nylorun dev` banner and `nylorun doctor sandbox`.
