# Changelog

All notable changes to `@nylorun/harness` are documented in this file.

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before 1.0, the public API is experimental: breaking changes may occur in minor releases, while patch releases are reserved for compatible fixes.

## [0.5.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-28

### Breaking changes since 0.4.0-rc.1

- Replaced persistent `prefix` configuration with per-step `configuration`. Instructions, tools, model selection, and runtime context are assembled afresh for every model call; slot removal, context lifetimes, strict prefix policy, and Harness-owned drift auditing were removed. Middleware receives `turnId` and `stepId` to coordinate application-owned state.
- `model.prefix` and `model.started` were replaced by `model.requested`, emitted immediately before adapter invocation with the exact immutable `ModelCall` and JSON-safe attributed configuration/context snapshots.
- `tool()` now validates and normalizes its synchronous Zod object schema eagerly; raw tool literals retain first-bind preparation.

- Model adapters now receive the projected `ModelCall` as their first argument and `{ request, signal }` as their second. Implementations that consumed the prior request-shaped input must migrate to the projection and use `request` for the structured escape hatch.
- `InputHandle.consume()` and `AgentRunInput` were removed. Submit messages and interaction replies through the Session input API and await the returned completion handle instead.
- `session.observe()` now returns an idempotent unsubscribe function rather than the previous observer result. Observers remain live-only and do not replay history.
- Tool adapters and the tool facade removed the prior route-validation and route metadata methods. Tool definitions use `parameters` and `executeWith`; dispatch validation happens at the sealed Harness boundary.
- Harness-owned failures now use `HarnessError` with stable machine-readable codes. The prior outcome-code model has been replaced; see the migration table in the README for renamed and split codes. Foreign application, model, and adapter errors remain available as causes.

### Added

- `ModelCall` projection, including canonical system text, transcript messages, provider tool contracts, model directive, and session id.
- Explicit abort propagation through the Model adapter context.
- Stable structured Harness errors via `HarnessError`, `HarnessErrorCode`, and `isHarnessError`.
- Parallel sibling tool execution by default, with an optional shared per-adapter `maxConcurrentCalls` limit on `.with(adapter, options)`.

### Fixed

- Observe attributes are materialized only when a listener is registered. Transcript snapshots on `step.started` share the already-frozen step transcript rather than deep-copying it on every step.
