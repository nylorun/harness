# Changelog

## 0.10.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- c49efed: **Runtime Clients and Admin API (supporting packages).**

  - **core:** `AdminStatusSchema`, Project-link schemas, `ERROR_CODES` (launcher codes include `platform_unsupported`, `launcher_failed`, `downgrade_refused`), `admin-status` feature, `newPrincipalId`, `compareVersions`.
  - **runtime:** `/v1/admin/status` (alias `/v1/admin/host`), loopback/`Origin`/content-type checks; the launcher ships as this package's `nylorun-runtime` bin (source under `src/launcher/`, not in `exports`) and runs the Host on the Node it runs on.
  - **studio:** `nylorun-studio` binary; connects via `resolveConnection`; waits for `dev`; never calls Admin API or writes `.nylorun/`.

  **Prerequisites:** developers install Node 24+ and `@nylorun/runtime` (`npm install --global @nylorun/runtime`) themselves; no package downloads Node or the Runtime, and there are no per-platform Runtime packages. Launcher commands: `version`, `up`, `down`, `restart`, `run`, `status`, `logs` (launcher protocol 1).

- c49efed: **Breaking (pre-1.0 minor):** Replace a single SQLite Runtime per Project or home directory with a **Runtime Host** that serves isolated **Tenants**, selected by `Nylorun-Tenant` and negotiated with `Nylorun-Protocol` (protocol `2`, feature `runtime-tenants`). Vocabulary: Host root + Tenant + Project link.

  - **core:** `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 2`, `HOST_PROTOCOL`, `TENANT_HEADER`, `PROTOCOL_HEADER`, `newTenantId` / `isTenantId`, `checkCompatibility`; health schema gains `hostId` + `protocol` (`service: "nylorun-runtime"`); Tenant/admin wire schemas; Tenant model routes under `/v1/tenant/*`.
  - **runtime:** Host process + Tenant module; Tenant model routes under `/v1/tenant/*`; `startEphemeralRuntime` for tests/embeds; executors via `PUT /v1/executors`; sandbox prefix `nylorun-<tenant-id>-`.
  - **agents:** `createClient({ url, key, tenant })`; Transport sends Tenant + protocol headers; `/health` compatibility cache; `IncompatibleRuntimeError` with upgrade remedies.
  - **cli:** Host root lifecycle (`runtime up|down|status|logs|restart|run`); Project link (`.nylorun/link.json` + `credentials.json`); `tenant` commands; `runtime status --env` exports `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_URL`, `NYLORUN_SERVER_KEY`, `NYLORUN_TENANT`; removed Project/home SQLite selectors.
  - **studio:** `startStudio({ …, tenant: { id, name } })`; proxy forwards Tenant + protocol headers; UI shows Tenant name/short id.

- fd9fd87: Add workflows: compose agents and `tool()` with `Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map`, and `Loop`. A workflow is a registered runnable (`kind: "workflow"`) with the same session API as an agent — `export const agents`, `saveAgent` (saves referenced agents first), `createSession`, `input` (`content` or `data`), `observe({ follow })`, `pending`, `approve`, `cancel`. Slots (`{ run, id?, input? }`) reshape data between nodes. The flow engine (`runFlowDurable`) returns effects only; `harness/src/loop/` and `runDurable` are unchanged.

  HostEffect gains flow kinds `agent`, `tool` (node), `fn`, and `verify`, each with `path`, `key`, and `iterations`. The Runtime drives agent nodes through the public session contract (linked sessions, shared sandbox via `PutSession.sandbox`), offers `fn` / `verify` again on lease expiry, and routes executor Actions by `(workflowId, key)` with claim-scoped `ctx.sandbox`. Optional `message.manifest` is a turn-only variant of the session pin (turn manifests). Studio shows the manifest tree, live node status, and session links. Examples under `examples/agents/{chain,switch,parallel,map,loop,ship-feature}/`.

## 0.9.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 1cd7dc7: Add subagents: put an agent in another agent's `tools` (`Agent({ tools: [lookupOrder, researcher] })` or `.use({ tools: [researcher] })`) and the model can delegate to it. The tool is named after the agent's id, takes `{ task: string }`, and its description is the agent's `description`, which is now required for an agent used as a tool. The engine runs the child inside the parent's turn as a durable branch: fresh context, its own tools and hooks served by the root agent's executor, its own MCP servers, the session's sandbox, and only its final output (or `outputSchema` result) returned. Empty output, failures (with partial output marked as evidence), and requests for input or approval inside a child reach the parent as failed tool results. Parallel delegation calls run concurrently, completed child work is never re-run on replay, and cancelling the session cancels every child.

  v1 is one level deep and non-interactive. Nested delegation, child tools that declare `approval`, and differing sandboxes across the tree fail the build with a named diagnostic. The manifest adds an optional `agent` body on a tool (schema version unchanged), actions and effects carry `agent: { id, path, delegationId }`, tool context gains `ctx.agent`, the durable host resolves a new `delegation` effect kind, and the Runtime emits `delegation.started` / `delegation.completed` events and filters history with `?agent=` (`session.history({ agent })`). Studio shows delegations, labels child actions with their agent, and filters events by agent.

## 0.8.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- b8d822a: Studio Model Settings lists multiple vault-stored providers, adds credentials through a sheet, and switches the active provider/model via Runtime host vault APIs.
- b8d822a: Let a running Runtime learn its executors instead of receiving them all at startup.
  `PUT /v1/executors` registers or rotates scoped executor credentials with the application
  credential, `DELETE /v1/executors/:agentId` removes one, and `GET /v1/executors` lists them
  without disclosing secrets. Registrations persist in SQLite with the token hashed at rest and
  are restored on the next start; scopes supplied through `NYLORUN_EXECUTORS_JSON` still apply
  to that process, take precedence for their agent, and are never written to the database. An
  unchanged registration is idempotent and keeps open streams, while a rotation ends the
  replaced token's work stream and stops it authorizing. Unauthenticated `/health` now also
  reports the Runtime version, a non-reversible scope digest of the database path, and the
  process id; all three are optional in the contract so an older host still parses. Token
  hashing is adequate only because these credentials are high-entropy values minted by the
  host; it is not a password derivation.
- b8d822a: Remove the legacy in-process host. `httpModel`, `HttpModelOptions`, and `ModelEnvironment` are no longer exported from `@nylorun/runtime`, `localSessions` is no longer exported from `@nylorun/runtime/node`, and `modelSelection` is no longer exported from `@nylorun/runtime/configuration`. The internal `Runtime`, `serveAgents`, `openSession`, and AG-UI route are deleted. Host agents with `nylorun dev` / `nylorun serve` and the standalone Runtime.
- b8d822a: Add `sandbox()`: one `.use(sandbox())` gives an agent Runtime-executed `bash`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `grep` and `glob` tools on an isolated machine with a persistent `/workspace`. The Runtime selects a microsandbox microVM where available, otherwise an in-process virtual shell, enforces deny-by-default egress presets, owns sandbox lifecycle, and reports its choice through `GET /v1/host/sandbox`, the `nylorun dev` banner and `nylorun doctor sandbox`.
- b8d822a: Breaking beta: replace `beforeModelCall` / `afterModelCall` with scoped hooks. Register `before("turn" | "step", fn)` and `after("step" | "turn", fn)` on the agent, or `before: { turn, step }` / `after: { step, turn }` on a capability. `before("turn")` runs once per turn and its `Patch` applies to every model call in the turn; the new `after("turn")` returns a `TurnDecision` for the final answer. `after` hooks take one argument and receive `attempt`, and `retry` now retries instead of failing the run. The manifest moves to `manifestSchemaVersion: 4` with `capabilities[].hooks`, and `BeforeModelCallFn`, `AfterModelCallFn` and the `beforeModelCall` / `afterModelCall` action kinds are removed. Every capability registered at a hook point now runs in one `hook` executor action, an expired hook claim is offered again instead of becoming uncertain, and the durable engine version is `hosted-2`. Hook toggles now hide a capability's tools, or one tool of a multi-tool capability, instead of having no effect or failing. Studio lists each capability's hooks with how often they run and labels hook actions. See MIGRATION.md.

## 0.7.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 3a88f51: Ship Agent-Plugins (`plugin()` / `loadPlugin`), Skills (`load_skill` / skill resources), Runtime MCP pool + vault credentials, and manifest v3 capability fields. Validate completed tool `output` against the tool output schema so ordinary tools with `outputSchema` no longer false-fail as `tool.invalid-output`.

## 0.6.0-beta

### Major Changes

- 2898d02: Extract shared definitions and contracts into core and local orchestration into
  CLI. Harness becomes execution-only; the SDK no longer installs the engine and
  Runtime no longer depends on the SDK. Author applications through agents and
  install cli for the unchanged nylorun commands. See the package architecture and
  migration guide. Cloud installs published packages from npm independently.

### Minor Changes

- 41e613c: Ship the local SDK registry workflow with an independent SQLite Runtime, connected tool executor, authenticated Studio proxy, and a text-and-tool starter. Replace the legacy Hono starter and AG-UI transport. Require Node 24 and include the SDK in exact release compatibility pins.

  Break the Harness execution import from `/engine` to `/run` and rename hosted execution APIs to durable execution APIs, including RunBinding, BoundRunOptions, and createRunState. Update all consumers without compatibility aliases; retain persisted checkpoint fields and version pins.

## 0.5.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- Breaking beta: Runtime hosts use Harness `info` (`getInfo` / `SubmitOptions.info`) instead of
  `scope`. Session scheduling stays in Runtime; Node-only adapters remain under
  `@nylorun/runtime/node`. Compatible with Harness capability manifests and ToolDescriptor-only
  model requests.
- c5bbb1a: Breaking beta: make Harness `run()` a direct async state-in/state-out executor with
  serializable pauses, application `info`, cancellation signals, awaited recording, and
  agent-level output schemas. Runtime owns session scheduling with memory-default or exclusive
  local storage and imports Harness contracts. Isolate Node adapters under `runtime/node`, stream
  observations incrementally, and add opt-in bounded token previews with Studio reconciliation.
  Migrate consumers and deployment guidance together; legacy event records remain archived, not
  automatically replayed.

### Patch Changes

- Remove the experimental Cloud Agents API destination client and related
  `RuntimeConfig.cloud` / `NYLORUN_*` Cloud-mode wiring from OSS Runtime.
  Local `openSession` remains the only destination. Cloud upgrades published
  packages from npm independently.
- Ignore Hono Node `context.env` stream bindings (`incoming`/`outgoing`) when
  resolving model environment so Node `nylorun dev` uses process `.env` /
  `piModel` instead of an empty portable HTTP adapter.
- Update Runtime's canonical Harness dependency to the tested release.
- Updated dependencies [c5bbb1a]
  - @nylorun/harness@0.13.0-beta

## 0.4.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- fa1860a: Use standard MODEL_PROVIDER, MODEL, MODEL_PROVIDER_API_KEY, and MODEL_PROVIDER_BASE_URL environment configuration. Export starter Hono apps and provide CLI development and production Node launchers. Existing starters require manual migration. Release preparation must update the creator Runtime compatibility pin with this release.

## 0.3.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 9c350be: Provide `nylorun dev` with optional Studio and browser opening, automatic development loopback CORS, and inferred Hono mount paths. Move local model selection to `.env/model.json` with legacy fallback and migration. Generate starters without copied launcher scripts, a top-level config directory, or a separate TypeScript build config. Release preparation must update the creator's Runtime compatibility pin together with these changes.

## 0.2.1-beta

### Patch Changes

- fd24b00: Flatten Runtime agent routes to `/:id/...` and pass matching `basePath` from the Hono mount so discovery, manifests, and AG-UI resolve at `/agents/:id/...` for Studio.

## 0.2.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 4badb5b: Move model execution to session startup, provide Runtime as a mountable Hono router, and generate Hono-first projects with supervised application and Studio development. Studio now resolves root-relative Runtime endpoints correctly for custom mount paths.

## 0.1.2-beta

### Patch Changes

- d27242c: Show stopped guardrail and failed model requests as errors in Studio. Runtime now emits a terminal AG-UI error instead of marking failed requests successful, and Studio displays the reported message. The guardrails example also checks text content parts sent by Studio, including mixed media input, before invoking the model.
- d27242c: Preserve opaque provider continuation metadata through assistant conversation history. Gemini tool calls now retain thought signatures when sending tool results back to the model, including signed empty text and reasoning blocks. Only the originating provider and model receive their signatures.

## 0.1.1-beta

### Patch Changes

- 54ab304: Configure the provider and model after project installation and before development
  starts. Add --skip-config for deferred setup and require it for noninteractive
  creation. Retain the project with recovery instructions when setup fails or is
  cancelled, and cancel pending prompts, authentication, and child processes on
  shutdown.
- 54ab304: Add `--host` and `--allowed-hosts` to `nylorun dev` and `nylorun start`, with
  `HOST` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment equivalents. Loopback binds now answer only
  to their own address on the chosen port, so local development needs no setup on
  any port while DNS-rebinding pages are rejected. Publish with `--host 0.0.0.0` or
  list proxy host names to deploy on your own servers.
- 54ab304: Support portable Runtime protocol version 2 while retaining legacy Studio
  manifest support. Move the Studio CLI into Runtime: use `nylorun studio
--agent-url <url>` instead of `nylo studio`. Applications should install Runtime
  directly and keep Studio as a development dependency.

  Retain session lists and media across development reloads, and recognize agent
  file changes on Windows. Validate noninteractive creator startup during release
  verification with deferred provider configuration.

  Include Harness in this release so the creator does not rely on an unpublished
  compatibility pin. Ship and verify all four packages together.

Release notes are maintained with Changesets.
