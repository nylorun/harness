# OSS runtime implementation notes

Historical core-pass record. The subsequent local release migrated CLI/creator/Studio and ran focused functional acceptance. Prefer package READMEs, [src/CONTEXT.md](./src/CONTEXT.md), and changelogs for current **Runtime Host** / **Tenant** vocabulary and status.

**Build/startup verification only; functional correctness and end-to-end behavior remain unverified.**

New standalone implementation is a **Runtime Host** (`src/host/`) plus per-**Tenant** runtime (`src/tenant/`), using `@nylorun/harness` through the public workspace. Local candidate digests for this repo’s packs belong in release notes / changelogs; Cloud upgrades via npm after publish, not via in-repo vendor artifacts. Node 24 is required for `node:sqlite`.

Built capabilities (current Host + Tenant model):

- Independent standalone HTTP Host and `@nylorun/runtime/core` entry (`startEphemeralRuntime` for tests); no customer function bodies in execution manifests.
- Per-Tenant SQLite transactional definitions, pinned sessions, command receipts, immutable segment checkpoints, per-effect journal, actions, waits (within session checkpoint), canonical events and opaque resumable cursors.
- Detached scheduling, one-process ownership per Tenant (`.runtime-lock`), persisted runnable startup discovery, conservative model-intent uncertainty, cancellation fencing and inspectable uncertain actions/effects.
- Separate application/executor credentials; SSE notifications, persisted discovery, exclusive claims, generations, heartbeats, expiry to uncertainty, matching duplicate result receipts and conflict rejection. Executors register via `PUT /v1/executors`.
- Cancellation fences the current turn and permits later messages in the same session. New turns resume the state preceding the cancelled turn, while canonical history retains its events. Claimed/model work with ambiguous external outcomes remains inspectable as uncertain; late old-turn settlement cannot mutate a later turn.
- Failed turns retain their failed checkpoint in the SQLite checkpoints table (keyed by session/turn/segment) and their effect/event journal, but restore the pre-turn session state for later messages so abandoned tool plans cannot run under a new turn.
- Message, approval, response, cancellation and action-result commands; command retry identity ignores requestId but binds semantic payload to idempotencyKey.
- Runtime-owned scripted provider and configured generic model gateway; health/readiness (`service: "nylorun-runtime"`, `hostId`, protocol), launch command and lifecycle shutdown.
- Local-only session host path. Cloud-specific Agents API client modules are not part of OSS Runtime.
- Clients send `Nylorun-Tenant` + `Nylorun-Protocol`; Tenant model routes live under `/v1/tenant/*`.

Pre-existing foundations: provider/media adapters, CLI launcher, Hono router, old session storage and Studio/example helpers. These are not represented as newly built standalone runtime capabilities.

No milestone acceptance gate is marked complete by this table. The table maps the OSS portion of Target Architecture and Development Roadmap v1.1; shared harness and SDK work are covered in their package docs.

## Run and verification

Prefer `startEphemeralRuntime` with a temporary Host root for startup checks. Host environment is baseline-only (`PATH`, locale, `TZ`); Tenant config is not taken from ambient `NYLORUN_*` / model env. SDK environment: `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_URL`, `NYLORUN_SERVER_KEY`, `NYLORUN_EXECUTOR_KEY`, `NYLORUN_TENANT`, `NYLORUN_IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION`.

```sh
eval "$(npx nylorun runtime status --env)"
```

Startup health does not validate SQLite recovery, model gateway compatibility, tool execution or credentials against real user workloads.

## Functional testing handoff

1. Conversation history/instructions, tools and hook ordering, before/after state, structured output, action schema validation and stable replay identities.
2. Session/command idempotency (including changed requestId), conflicts, exact duplicate action results after expiry, stale claim rejection, observer/executor authorization and Tenant mismatch.
3. Subscribe-before-discovery, SSE reconnect and replay cursors, committed action notification ordering, concurrent results and multiple tools, slow/disconnected observers.
4. Human approval/response identity and type, denial, cancellation during model/tool dispatch, late results and waiting/uncertainty visibility; new messages after cancellation, repeated cancellation and old-turn settlement/recovery fencing.
5. Restart recovery of runnable/paused/waiting work, expired claims, model intent with missing outcome, process ownership and locked database behavior. No automatic repeated uncertain external effect should occur.
6. Cross-runtime protocol, manifests, behavior, event ordering and version rejection.
7. Cross-Tenant isolation: same agent id in two Tenants; opaque 404 for foreign credentials; sandbox prefix isolation.

## Missing implementation versus unverified behavior

Missing: operations for reconciling uncertain effects; timed sleep and external wait-for wakeup commands; bounded history pagination/retention; multi-replica scheduling; provider-specific gateway adapters for the new standalone host; administrative credential rotation; full conformance tooling. Session migration/export/import is deferred. A custom provider must honor AbortSignal for graceful draining. Executor registrations persist per Tenant via `PUT /v1/executors`.

Implemented but unverified: all durable model/action replay, claim/result fencing, approvals/responses, cancellation, SSE ordering, startup recovery, output validation and cross-runtime compatibility. SQLite storage is intentionally local and single-process per Tenant; no shared filesystem promise. All applicable functional gates remain open for the later testing agent.
