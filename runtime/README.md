# @nylorun/runtime

The independent OSS **Runtime Host** consumes `@nylorun/harness/run` and
`@nylorun/core/contracts`. Cloud installs published `@nylorun/harness` from npm
and does not import this package. Client authoring and sessions belong to
`@nylorun/agents`; the Host's status and derived keys belong to `@nylorun/admin`.
Vocabulary: [src/CONTEXT.md](./src/CONTEXT.md).

Requires Node 24+. Build from the repository root:

```sh
npm install
npm run build --workspace @nylorun/core
npm run build --workspace @nylorun/harness
npm run build --workspace @nylorun/runtime
```

## Running the Runtime

The Runtime runs as the `ghcr.io/nylorun/runtime` image, next to Postgres,
Restate and S2: `nylorun start` runs them, as a local Tenant, on a developer machine. The
package is a library with no bin; its Host entry is `@nylorun/runtime/server`
(`dist/host/main.js`), which requires `NYLORUN_DATABASE_URL`. For tests and
ephemeral embeds, use `startEphemeralRuntime()` from `@nylorun/runtime/core`.
See [MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md).

A Runtime serves one **Tenant**: an installation is one Runtime with its own
Postgres database, Restate and S2 basin, and two Tenants are two installations. No
Tenant state lives only in the Runtime process. The Tenant's data is its Postgres
database, in the fixed schemas `nylorun` (its state: the Session Store) and
`nylorun_streams` (the record of its session events). Drizzle defines the tables
(`src/store/postgres/schema.ts`) and generates the migrations, which ship in the package
(`dist/store/postgres/drizzle/`). At startup the Host applies the missing ones in one
transaction under an advisory lock, records them in `nylorun.__drizzle_migrations`, and
refuses a database holding a migration it does not ship (`schema-too-new`); then, on
first start, it creates the Tenant there: its id (`NYLORUN_TENANT_ID`, default a
new one), its name (`NYLORUN_TENANT_NAME`, default `default`), its Studio principal and
the derived principals (`NYLORUN_DERIVED_PRINCIPALS`, default `project`) whose keys the
admin key derives. A database written by a Runtime that kept several Tenants in one
database (`tenant_<id>` schemas), or by a pre-release build of one Tenant per database
(`schema_version` tables), is refused: this release starts fresh on a new database. Restate runs one advance of a session at a time and holds the Tenant's sweep
timer (Durable Session Execution); every session's events are relayed from the record to
its own S2 stream, which history and SSE read (Durable Streams). One image runs every **service**,
and `--service` picks what a process runs: `core` serves the Tenant API, Admin
API and SSE and runs the stream relay, `loop` runs advances (the Worker), and
`gates` is the Model Gate, the only process that reads a model credential and
calls providers. `core` and `loop` may share a process; `gates` never joins
them. A local Tenant packs `core,loop` into the `runtime` container and
`gates` into the `gateway` container (the combined packing). `--role
api|worker|all` is the deprecated name of `--service core`, `loop` and
`core,loop`.

`harness` runs alone: agent turns, stdio MCP servers and workspaces, apart from
core. With `NYLORUN_HARNESS=remote`, core runs no turn itself and opens the
Harness API listener (`NYLORUN_HARNESS_LISTEN_HOST`, `NYLORUN_HARNESS_LISTEN_PORT`,
default 4200, `NYLORUN_HARNESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS`), which accepts only
`NYLORUN_HARNESS_TOKEN`; `in-process` (the default outside Compose) runs turns in
core's process. A `harness` process needs `NYLORUN_HARNESS_URL`,
`NYLORUN_HARNESS_TOKEN`, `NYLORUN_GATES_URL` and `NYLORUN_HARNESS_ROOT` (default
`/harness`), answers `/health` on `127.0.0.1:4300`, and refuses to start with a
database, Restate, keys or gates credential in its environment. A local Tenant
runs it in the `harness` container, on a network with only the runtime and the
gateway ([DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md#the-harness-agent-turns-mcp-servers-and-workspaces)).

The container is configured by its environment, which a local Tenant's Compose file
sets: `NYLORUN_DATABASE_URL` (required), `NYLORUN_RESTATE_INGRESS_URL`,
`NYLORUN_RESTATE_ADMIN_URL`, `NYLORUN_WORKER_URL` and
`NYLORUN_RESTATE_IDENTITY_KEY` (Restate), `NYLORUN_S2_ENDPOINT` and
`NYLORUN_S2_TOKEN`, and in container mode `NYLORUN_LISTEN_HOST`,
`NYLORUN_LISTEN_PORT`, `NYLORUN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `NYLORUN_PUBLIC_URL`, plus
`NYLORUN_BROWSER_ACCESS` (`on` or `off`) and the operator listener
(`NYLORUN_ADMIN_LISTEN_PORT`, `NYLORUN_ADMIN_LISTEN_HOST`,
`NYLORUN_ADMIN_ALLOWED_HOSTS`). A process that runs `loop` sends its model
calls to the gate at `NYLORUN_GATES_URL`; in a container it refuses to start
without it and `NYLORUN_GATES_TOKEN`. That token is core's credential: the gate
accepts only it for vault writes, token signing and Action deliveries. Model and
remote MCP calls carry a run token instead, which the loop mints for each
session it advances, and the gate takes the call's session, turn and agent from
it; a token whose turn was cancelled or whose session another process took over
is refused with `409 run_stale`. A `gates` process needs only
`NYLORUN_DATABASE_URL`, `NYLORUN_GATES_TOKEN`, its listener
(`NYLORUN_GATES_LISTEN_HOST`, `NYLORUN_GATES_LISTEN_PORT`, default 4100, and
`NYLORUN_GATES_ALLOWED_HOSTS`) and the Host's `tenant/` directory, which it
never writes; it serves the database's one Tenant. With `egress`
(`--service gates,keys,egress`, for pod sandboxes) the same process runs
egress-gate on `NYLORUN_EGRESS_LISTEN_HOST`:`NYLORUN_EGRESS_LISTEN_PORT`
(default `0.0.0.0:4200`): a CONNECT proxy that admits a pod's egress token and
tunnels only to the hosts its sandbox spec allows, on 443 or 80, never to a
private address. `NYLORUN_PACKING` (`combined` or `split`) is logged at startup.

With an operator listener (a local Tenant's default: container port 4001), the Host
serves two ports. The public one serves the Tenant API, to browsers too when
browser access is on, and answers admin routes with the opaque `404`. The
operator one serves the Admin API, Host shutdown and the Tenant API, never to
browsers; keep it on loopback or a private network and never proxy it. Outside
a container, `adminPort` in `host.json` does the same on loopback.

The Host root is `NYLORUN_HOME` or `~/.nylorun` (for a local Tenant,
`~/.nylorun/tenants/<name>/`, bind-mounted at `/nylorun` in its containers). What stays on the Host is under `tenant/`.

## Layout

```text
<host root>/
  host.json                 # format 1: hostId, host, port, adminPort?, runtimeVersion, …
  host-credentials.json     # adminKey (0600)
  docker/                   # compose.yaml, .env (0600), Restate identity key
  tenant/                   # vault-kek, plugin-data, logs, home, tmp, sandboxes
```

## HTTP surface

| Route | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | none | `service: "nylorun-runtime"`, `hostId`, protocol `{min,max,features}`, pid |
| `GET /ready` | none | Listener up, the Tenant open, and Postgres, Restate and S2 answer (`checks`) |
| `GET /openapi.json` | none | The Tenant API's OpenAPI 3.2 document (below); refuses an `Origin` |
| `GET /v1/admin/status` | admin key | `AdminStatusSchema`: the Host, its protocol and its Tenant (`tenant`: id, name, `open` or `unavailable`, and the cause when it could not be opened); alias `GET /v1/admin/host`. On the operator listener when there is one |
| `POST /v1/admin/host/shutdown` | admin key | Host-private; not in `@nylorun/admin` |
| `GET /v1/admin/openapi.json` | admin key | The Admin API's OpenAPI 3.2 document |
| `/v1/*` Tenant routes | application key, subject token or delivery token | Require `Nylorun-Protocol`; nothing names the Tenant |
| `GET /v1/artifact-links/{token}` | the link itself | A capability link to one artifact version (protocol 6): no credential, no `Nylorun-Protocol`, Range supported; a folder's link opens its zip, or one of its files |

Every route checks `Host` first (`421 host_rejected`) and rejects non-JSON bodies
with `415 unsupported_media_type`, except an artifact upload (`POST /v1/artifacts`,
`POST /v1/artifacts/{id}/versions`), whose body is the file in any media type. An `Origin` is `403 origin_rejected` on
`/health`, `/ready`, admin routes, and everywhere when browser access is off.
With browser access on (feature `browser-access`: a local Tenant's default, or
`browserAccess` in `host.json`), the Host answers preflights for browser routes
from the route alone, and the Tenant admits an `Origin` only with a publishable
key (`Nylorun-Key`) that lists it, adding CORS headers only then; Tenant keys
and delivery tokens are refused from browsers before they are looked up. Missing or
unsupported protocol → `426` before authentication (the Host serves protocols 4, 5 and 6;
protocol 6 adds file and folder artifacts and message `parts`; at each turn's end the
Runtime exports `/workspace/outputs` of the session's sandbox as a version of its
`outputs` folder, read at `/v1/artifacts/{id}/versions/{n|latest}/tree`, `/files/{path}`,
`/diff?from=` and `/zip`). Protocol 5 and 6 clients name no Tenant. A protocol 4 client's `Nylorun-Tenant` naming
another Tenant (or malformed), a publishable key of another Tenant, a Tenant that
could not be opened and rejected credentials → opaque `404` with identical body. A path or method no route serves is `404 Route not found`
once the caller is known.

## API reference (OpenAPI)

The Runtime describes its APIs as OpenAPI 3.2 documents, generated from the routes it serves,
so they cannot drift from its answers:

| Document | In the package | Served | On each release |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tenant API | `@nylorun/runtime/openapi.json` | `GET /openapi.json` | `openapi.json` |
| Admin API | `@nylorun/runtime/admin-openapi.json` | `GET /v1/admin/openapi.json` (admin key) | `admin-openapi.json` |

The release assets are on the `@nylorun/runtime@<version>` GitHub Release. Point any OpenAPI 3.2
tool at one of them; for [Scalar](https://scalar.com), the package file of a version works as is:

```text
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nylorun/runtime@<version>/dist/openapi.json
```

Each operation's `security` says which credentials it takes (application key, subject token,
publishable key, delivery token, admin key), and its `x-nylorun-credentials`,
`x-nylorun-scopes` (the subject scopes that reach it) and `x-nylorun-browser` fields say who
may call it. Event streams are `text/event-stream` with an `itemSchema`. `runtime/openapi/` holds the committed snapshots: a change to a route changes
them (`node scripts/build-openapi.mjs --write`), and `check-package` fails until they are
updated.

## HTTP layer

Routes are Hono routes (`@hono/zod-openapi`), each declared once with who may call it
(`api/http/define.ts`): that declaration serves the route, checks subject scopes, answers
browser preflights and makes the OpenAPI document. `host/` holds the listeners, the `Host`
check (in Node, before Hono) and the Host pipeline (`host/app.ts`); `api/` the Tenant and
Admin routes (`api/http/routes/`, `api/ag-ui/`, `api/a2a/`, `host/admin-api.ts`). Only `host/`
and `api/` import Hono.

## Embedding and tests

Tests and ephemeral embeds use `startEphemeralRuntime()` from
`@nylorun/runtime/core`: private Host on port 0, temporary Host root, one Tenant,
returns `{ url, tenantId, applicationKey, adminKey, close() }`. Its Tenant is the
one Tenant of the Postgres database you pass as `database` (required): a pool, which
you end, or a URL, for which it opens a pool and ends it on `close()`. It creates the
Tenant there on first start, as a Host does (with `tenantId`, `name` and an application
principal for `applicationKey`), and serves the Tenant a database already holds. The
data stays after `close()`; give each test Tenant its own database and drop it
afterwards. Its
streams and scheduling are in process and gone after `close()`. The smoke checks do
not use it; they reset and seed a temporary local Tenant
(`scripts/lib/stack-tenant.mjs`).

```ts
const runtime = await startEphemeralRuntime({
  hostRoot, // a temporary directory
  database: "postgres://nylorun:nylorun@127.0.0.1:55432/my_test_db",
});
```

The package's own tests run every Session Store on Postgres: `npm test` gives each
test file a database on the Docker test stack (`test/stack/compose.yaml`) and starts
the stack when it is down; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Register Action endpoints with `PUT /v1/endpoints` using the application principal
(`createActionHandler(...).register({ url })` in `@nylorun/agents` does this). The
Runtime delivers each Action there with an `http` or `https` POST, so the URL must be
reachable from the Runtime. Model gateway
and sandbox backend are Tenant configuration (vault / seed), not Host process
env.

## Session behaviour

The session-first `/v1` API is specified in
[HOST_CONTRACT.md](../harness/HOST_CONTRACT.md). Application tokens authorize
definition/session APIs. The Runtime delivers Actions to Action endpoints, and a
delivery token authorizes only its own Action's heartbeat, result and sandbox calls.
Session observers cannot submit action results.

Postgres transactions persist session checkpoints, command receipts, individual
effects/actions, waits and the record of session events — in the Tenant's database; history is
read from Durable Streams (S2). An advance owns its session through a lease with
an epoch; a Worker that takes over after a crash marks in-flight effects
`uncertain`. Vault ciphertext needs that Tenant's own KEK.

Agents that declare `.use(sandbox())` get Runtime-executed sandbox tools. The
Tenant owns each sandbox; backend names are prefixed `nylorun-<tenant-id>-`.

## Local Project workflow

A project depends on `@nylorun/agents` only. `npx nylorun start` in the project
runs its local Tenant (Docker), named after the project directory, and writes
the Project link (outside a project it runs the Tenant `default`); the project's `npm run dev` runs `src/main.ts` under
`tsx watch`; `npx nylorun studio` opens Studio on that Tenant.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `kek-missing` | Restore `vault-kek` in the Tenant directory |
| `GET /ready` is 503 and `/v1/admin/status` names a `tenant.cause` | The Tenant could not be opened; every Tenant request is the opaque `404`. Follow the cause's `repair`, then restart the Runtime |
| `corrupt` / `migration-failed` / `envelope-invalid` / `open-failed` / `open-timeout` | Follow the cause's `repair` string |
| `schema-too-new` | Run a Runtime at least as new as the one that migrated the database |
| `database-layout-old` | The database holds `tenant_<id>` schemas of an older Runtime, or the `schema_version` tables of a pre-release one: point the Runtime at a new database (locally, a new Tenant: `nylorun start --tenant <new name>`); the old one is left as it is |
| `426 protocol_unsupported` | Upgrade clients or Host to a compatible set |
| `421 host_rejected` / `403 origin_rejected` | In a container, list the `Host` in `NYLORUN_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. From a browser, use a subject token and a publishable key that lists the page's origin, never a Tenant key |
| `503` for a Tenant | Postgres or Restate is unreachable; `GET /ready` names which |
| Port in use | Change `NYLORUN_PORT` in `~/.nylorun/tenants/<name>/docker/.env` and run `nylorun start` |
| Logs | `nylorun logs runtime` |

Definitions have no `agent.run()`; applications use `@nylorun/agents`.
