import { PINNED_IMAGES } from "./images.js";

/**
 * A local Tenant's Compose file (Runtime Architecture §14.3), written to
 * `<Host root>/docker/compose.yaml` by `nylorun start`. Each local Tenant is one installation
 * (tenancy.md §6): its own Compose project (`nylorun-<name>`, the file's `name`), volumes,
 * network and ports. Container, network and volume names are global on the Docker engine, so
 * every one is `<project>-<role>` (`nylorun-shop-studio`, network `nylorun-shop`, volume
 * `nylorun-shop-postgres`), labelled `dev.nylorun.tenant: <name>`; they are written here, from
 * the project and the Tenant's name. Everything else that varies (ports, the Postgres password and the other
 * secrets, UID/GID, the Host root, the images) comes from `docker/.env`.
 *
 * The Tenant's state is its Postgres database, executed through Restate, with its
 * history in s2-lite; the Runtime's /ready checks all three. Postgres initialises the
 * database with C collation (`--locale=C`) and runs with `wal_level=logical`: the stream
 * relay feeds s2-lite from the record over logical replication (Durable Streams), and
 * `max_slot_wal_keep_size` caps the WAL a stuck relay can hold. The Runtime creates the
 * Tenant on its first start, with its name (`NYLORUN_TENANT_NAME`) and the derived
 * principals of `NYLORUN_DERIVED_PRINCIPALS` (`project` for the Project link).
 *
 * Restate signs requests to the Worker endpoint with the private key in
 * `docker/restate-identity.pem`, mounted read-only; the Runtime gets the public
 * key as NYLORUN_RESTATE_IDENTITY_KEY.
 *
 * The combined packing (blueprint D12): the `runtime` container runs the core
 * and loop services, and the `gateway` container runs gates: the Model Gate,
 * which alone reads model credentials, and the Tool Gate (F4.1), which alone
 * holds remote MCP connections and their credentials and POSTs every Action
 * delivery. Every model call, remote MCP call and delivery of the loop crosses it
 * (NYLORUN_GATES_URL, with NYLORUN_GATES_TOKEN from `.env`, or a run's token from the
 * harness); MCP stdio servers run in the harness container. The gateway also runs keys (F4.2): the only
 * holder of the vault key, it runs every vault write that touches a secret and signs
 * every token (NYLORUN_KEYS_URL). The gateway mounts only the Host's Tenant directory
 * (`tenant/`) and its keys directory (`keys/`, the vault key), read-only: never
 * host-credentials.json. The runtime mounts the Host root with `keys/` and `docker/`
 * covered by empty read-only mounts, so it can read neither the vault key nor
 * Restate's private key and `.env`. The runtime does not wait for the gateway: while
 * it is down, model and MCP calls fail, deliveries are retried, vault writes and
 * token minting answer 503, and the session takes the next message.
 *
 * The Object store (blueprint D35) is RustFS, single node and single drive, pinned by digest,
 * on the `rustfs` volume; it is not published. Its credential is the access key `nylorun` and
 * the secret key NYLORUN_OBJECT_STORE_SECRET_KEY from `.env`, and only the runtime and the
 * gateway receive it (NYLORUN_OBJECT_STORE_*). The runtime creates the bucket at boot and
 * reaches the store through its `s3` BlobStore.
 *
 * With `sandboxes` (after `nylorun sandbox enable`, F7.2) the `sandboxes` service runs the
 * agent-sandbox driver: the only container holding the cluster credentials
 * (`<Host root>/sandboxes`, read-only), not published, reached by the runtime alone with
 * NYLORUN_SANDBOXES_TOKEN. The runtime gets an empty read-only mount over that directory.
 * The gateway then also runs egress-gate (`--service gates,keys,egress`), pods' CONNECT proxy to
 * the hosts their spec allows, published on NYLORUN_SANDBOX_BIND at NYLORUN_SANDBOX_EGRESS_PORT.
 *
 * The harness (F6.2, `harness: "remote"`, the default) runs every agent turn, MCP stdio server
 * and workspace in its own container: the runtime image with `--service harness`, connected to
 * core's Harness API (`ws://runtime:4200/nylorun/harness/v1`) with NYLORUN_HARNESS_TOKEN, its
 * only credential, and calling models and remote MCP servers through the gateway with each
 * run's token. It mounts only the Tenant's `sandboxes/`, `plugin-data/`, `home/` and `tmp/`
 * under `/harness`, and the Host root's `plugins/` read-only at its own path (plugin roots name
 * paths on this machine; the runtime mounts it there too). NYLORUN_HARNESS=in-process in `.env`
 * rolls back to turns in the runtime container, without the harness service.
 *
 * Three networks: `store` (internal: no egress) joins Postgres, s2-lite, Restate and RustFS to
 * the runtime and the gateway; `harness` joins the harness to the runtime and the gateway only;
 * `default` carries egress and the published ports (runtime, gateway, Studio, sandboxes).
 * Restate's admin port (its UI, unauthenticated) is published, and Restate joins `default`,
 * only with `restateUi` (`nylorun start --restate-ui`).
